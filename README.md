Y-STR Allele Comparison Tool (C++)
This project is a command-line C++ tool designed to automate the comparison of Y-STR allele profiles between father–son duos.
It was developed as part of a large-scale forensic genetics research analyzing rapidly mutating Y-STR markers.

🔍 Features
Reads father–son allele data from structured files (ie: genotype tables)
Automatically compares allele values (father allele vs. son allele)
Detects mutations (single-step, multi-step, microvariants, and multi-copy events)
Highlights mismatches
Removes redundant columns
Produces clean, analysis-ready output
Supports variable allele counts (multi-copy loci)

📌 Purpose
This tool was created to replace manual spreadsheet comparisons, reducing human error and increasing the speed of genetic analysis across father–son duos.

To use the program, you just type the file path (should be .tsv), and the name you gave each father and son when prompted.
To end the program just type end, and you'll have your allelic comparisons ready!
